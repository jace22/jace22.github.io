<p>MADE IN THE USA SINCE 1889
In the midst of our current global economy, Carhartt has proven that affordable clothes can be made right here at home, and be successful
Since 1997, more than 600 textile factories have closed in the U.S. Today, less than 2% of the apparel purchased in the U.S. is actually made in the U.S. Carhartt gear is part of that 2%, yet we often far exceed that number. Since 1998, Carhartt has made more than 80 million pieces of apparel in the U.S. Though we do manufacture some of our durable products offshore, we have never stopped making products in the U.S. since we started in 1889. Everything Carhartt makes is designed in Dearborn, Michigan, just a few miles from our original HQ.
Carhartt employs more than 2,000 American workers, and more than 1,000 UFCW union members. Our “Made in the USA” line is built in four factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 2015, Carhartt purchased 19.5 million pounds of U.S. cotton from Mt. Vernon mills in Georgia—enough American cotton to cover more than 19,500 football fields. Crafting American-made products is an important part of Carhatt’s DNA, and important to the hardworking American towns where we build these products.

   <p> By giving Americans a choice to buy product actually made in America, Carhartt has ensured the survival of the American worker. No brand makes more rugged workwear in the U.S. than Carhartt – and we’re proud that we can dress a hardworking American, head-to-toe in the best workwear money can buy without charging a premium for manufacturing here. We exists to serve the worker, and without him or her, we wouldn’t be in business. Since 1889, we’ve never stopped making clothes in America. And we’ll never stop outworking them all. </p>
