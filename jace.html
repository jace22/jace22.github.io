    <h2>About Skiing</h2>
    <p>Skiing is a very popular winter sport and perhaps one of the most fun.Skiing is one of the fastest non-motorized sports on land. Skiers can ski faster than a car and this was proven by Simone Origone in 2006 that
 set a world speed skiing record at 156.2 miles per hour compared to the speed of road cars at 120 miles per hour. <br/>Skiing is extremely popular in the US with 40 states having ski resorts.
 Vail Mountain Resort in Colorado is the nation's largest and most visited ski resort.<br /> Around 1.5 million visitors enjoy skiing at the 5,289 acre resort annually.</p>    				
  
<p>The word ‘Ski’ is derived from the Norwegian word ‘skíð’ which means a split piece of wood.</p>

Did you know that skiing was originally a form of transportation in the mountains of Europe, well before it became a sport?

Skis have been used to win battles off and on screen
Soldiers in mountainous regions have been using skis as a mode of wartime transport for hundreds of years. And ski troops played an important role in both the first and the second world wars.
